- ✅ `aita/services/fuzzy.py` - Name matching with OCR error correction
- ✅ `aita/pipelines/ingest.py` - Main orchestration pipeline

**LLM Vision API Integration Details:**

1. **Workflow**: EasyOCR detects first pages → LLM vision extracts names from those pages only
2. **Method**: `IngestPipeline._extract_name_with_llm(name_region_image, image_name)`
3. **Process**:
   - Crop top 20% of first page images for name region
   - Save cropped image to temporary file
   - Upload to Google Cloud Storage using `storage_service.upload_image()`
   - Generate public URL for LLM access
   - Call `llm_client.complete_with_image(prompt, image_url)`
   - Parse response for "NAME: [student name]" format
   - Clean up temporary files (local + GCS)
4. **Model**: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp` via OpenRouter
5. **Prompt**: Instructs LLM to extract handwritten student name from cropped image
6. **Fallback**: If LLM extraction fails, pipeline continues with generic "Student_001" naming
7. **Configuration**: Set `use_llm_for_names=True` in pipeline initialization

**Integration Points:**
- `aita/services/llm/openrouter.py` - LLM client with vision support
- `aita/services/storage.py` - GCS upload for public URLs
- `aita/utils/prompts.py` - Name extraction prompt template (if needed)

**Usage:**
```python
pipeline = create_ingest_pipeline(
    data_dir=Path("data"),
    use_llm_for_names=True  # Enable LLM vision name extraction
)
results = pipeline.run_smart_grouping()
```
