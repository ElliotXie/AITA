General Grading Instructions for Math Exam

POINT DEDUCTION RULES:
- Deduct 0.5 points for arithmetic errors if the approach is correct
- Deduct 1 point for incorrect final answer if methodology is sound
- Deduct 2 points for using wrong formula or concept

PARTIAL CREDIT GUIDELINES:
- Give partial credit for correct setup even if execution fails
- Award points for clear work shown, even if incomplete
- Recognize alternative valid solution methods

FOCUS AREAS:
- Problem-solving approach and logical reasoning
- Correct application of mathematical concepts and formulas
- Clarity of explanation and organization of work
- Accuracy of final answers and proper notation

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- For calculation problems: Emphasize methodology over computational accuracy
- For proof problems: Look for logical structure and valid reasoning steps
- For explanation problems: Value conceptual understanding over memorized definitions
- Allow reasonable alternative notation and equivalent forms of answers

COMMON MISTAKES TO WATCH FOR:
- Sign errors in algebraic manipulation
- Forgetting to apply chain rule in derivatives
- Mixing up limit notation and function evaluation
- Incomplete or missing units in final answers
- Not showing sufficient work for full credit

GRADING CONSISTENCY:
- Apply the same standards across all students
- Be generous with partial credit for demonstrated understanding
- Document any unusual circumstances or creative solutions
- Round final scores to nearest 0.5 points
